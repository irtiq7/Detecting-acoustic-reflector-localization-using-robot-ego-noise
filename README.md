# Detecting Acoustic Reflector Using A Robot's Ego-noise

In this work, we propose utilizing the ego-noise of the robots, e.g, drones, constructively to localize acoustic reflectors which could enable the construction of novel collision avoidance systems using sound. This work was accepted as International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) held in Toronto, Canada in 2021

To simulate and use the proposed method. You would require download MATLAB and a signal generator mex-function for MATLAB
