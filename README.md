# Detecting-acoustic-reflector-localization-using-robot-ego-noise

Our recent paper was accepted at ICASSP 2021. In this work, we propose utilizing the ego-noise of the robots, e.g, drones, constructively to localize acoustic reflectors which could enable the construction of novel collision avoidance systems using sound.

To simulate and use the proposed method. You would require download MATLAB and a signal generator mex-function for MATLAB
