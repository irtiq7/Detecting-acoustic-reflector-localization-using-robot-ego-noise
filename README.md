# Detecting-acoustic-reflector-localization-using-robot-ego-noise
Our recent paper was accepted at ICASSP 2021. In this work, we propose utilizing the ego-noise of the robots, e.g, drones, constructively to localize acoustic reflectors which could enable the construction of novel collision avoidance systems using sound.
